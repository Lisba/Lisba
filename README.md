<h1> Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ABSphreak/ABSphreak/master/gifs/Hi.gif" width="40px"></h1>

- 🌱 I'm currently a frontend team lead software developer skilled in the javascript/typescript ecosystem.
- ⚡ Passionate about technology and discovering how things work, constantly seeking out new learning opportunities.
- 🤩 I find joy in learning about new technologies and enjoy playing with them on my own time. Happy to share my knowledge and help others on their learning journey.
- ✈️ Aviator Pilot! In love with aircraft. Feel free to strike up a conversation about aviation!
- 💬 Reach out if you have questions about airplanes or need assistance with mobile/web development. I may not be a super expert, but I'll do my best to help you. Let's connect and create amazing things!
- 😂 Fun fact: I learned to fly planes from the age of 19 but I learned to drive cars at the age of 30 (weird considering that I love auto mechanics) 😅.
